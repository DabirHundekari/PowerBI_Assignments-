Users can simply type or speak their questions in plain language, making data analysis more accessible to a wider audience within an organization.

2. Intuitive and Faster Insights: Natural language queries provide a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with data. Users can ask questions in a conversational manner, just as they would ask a colleague or search on the internet. This approach accelerates the process of obtaining insights as users can quickly formulate questions and receive instant responses in a natural and familiar manner.

3. Enhanced Data Exploration: Natural language queries enable users to explore data more dynamically. Users can ask ad-hoc questions, refine their queries based on the responses, and iteratively drill down into the data to gain deeper insights. This interactive and exploratory nature of natural language queries allows users to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the data more effectively.

4. Reduced Dependency on Predefined Visualizations: With natural language queries, users can ask specific questions and obtain targeted answers without relying solely on predefined visualizations or prebuilt reports. This flexibility empowers users to ask more customized or context-specific questions and receive relevant insights directly, reducing their dependence on predefined dashboards or reports.

Example:
Let's say you have sales data in Power BI and you want to understand the sales performance for a specific product category. Instead of manually navigating through visualizations or creating filters, you can use natural language queries. You could simply type or speak a question like, "What is the total sales amount for the Electronics category in the last quarter?" Power BI's natural language processing capabilities would understand the query and generate a visual or numeric response, providing you with the desired information instantly.
